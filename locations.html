    <p>The Meskel holiday, also known as the Feast of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross, is an important religious festival celebrated in Ethiopia. It commemorates the discovery of the True Cross by Empress Helena, the mother of Constantine the Great, in the 4th century.
        The holiday falls on September 27th in the Gregorian calendar (or September 28th in leap years) and is widely observed throughout Ethiopia. It holds deep religious and cultural significance for the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, which is the predominant Christian denomination in the country.
        The name "Meskel" means "cross" in the Ethiopian Amharic language, and the holiday centers around the veneration of the True Cross. According to tradition, Empress Helena had a revelation in a dream that led her to the location of the True Cross in Jerusalem. To celebrate this discovery, the lighting of a large bonfire, known as the "Demera," is a central part of the Meskel festivities.
        On the eve of Meskel, people gather in public squares, including the famous Meskel Square in Addis Ababa, and in towns and villages across the country. A large bonfire is built, typically using a tall wooden structure adorned with flowers, eucalyptus branches, and crosses. The bonfire is lit, and people sing hymns, dance, and celebrate around the flames.
        The lighting of the Demera symbolizes the spreading of the light of Christianity and the triumph of Good over Evil. It also signifies the connection between the historical event of the True Cross discovery and the religious faith of the Ethiopian people.
        On the day of Meskel itself, special church services are held, and processions take place, with clergy and believers dressed in colorful traditional attire. The processions often involve carrying a replica of the True Cross, along with religious icons and banners, while singing hymns and chanting prayers.
